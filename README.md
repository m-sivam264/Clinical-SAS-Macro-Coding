# Clinical-SAS-Macro-Coding



This repository is part of my **learning journey in Clinical SAS programming**, with a focus on practicing and improving **SAS Macro coding skills**. It is designed to show both my **progress as a beginner** and my ability to apply macros in **clinical research scenarios**.

## About

SAS Macros help make code more **efficient, reusable, and automated**.
In this repo, I am practicing:

* Basic macro concepts.
* Step-by-step progress to intermediate and advanced topics.
* Realistic **clinical trial examples** (SDTM/ADaM derivations and TLF generation).


## Learning Goals

* Strengthen my **understanding of SAS Macros** from beginner to advanced.
* Build a **Clinical SAS portfolio** for future opportunities.
* Show my **hands-on practice** and problem-solving approach.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `.sas` files in **SAS Studio / Base SAS / Enterprise Guide**.
3. Run the code and review the macro logic step by step.

*This is a personal practice project. I will keep updating it as I learn new concepts and clinical applications.*

 Do you also want me to prepare a **similar beginner-friendly professional README** for your **Base-SAS-Practice** repo, so both repos look consistent?
